### Q1. Do the generated outputs match the ones in the paper in the target group's repo?

Yes, the simulated data is an exact match to the ones generated in the paper. However, there was an error while knitting the paper.Rmd as knitr::include_graphics() was not able to locate some files (figure4-ori.png,figure5-ori.png,table1_re.png,table2_re.png, table3_re.png).

### Q2. Are the differences relevant or not?

There were no differences between the simulated plots by the target group and the rerun of plots.

### Q3. Are used pieces of software and data properly CITED and with suitable LICENSES?

### Q4. Are open formats (text-based) included?

### Q5. Is data and software FAIR?
